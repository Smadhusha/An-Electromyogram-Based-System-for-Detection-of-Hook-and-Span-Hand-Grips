# An-Electromyogram-Based-System-for-Detection-of-Hook-and-Span-Hand-Grips
This project presents an electromyography (EMG) based hand grip recognition system for the detection of hook and span hand grips.

- The model is able to distinguish between the hand grips hook and span based on EMG.
- The signal acquisition for two hand grips was carried out using a clarity medical EMG machine having 4 channels. 
- The data was extracted using Octopus software. 
- The readings of 8 healthy subjects were taken.

- The hook activity included lifting an object using a hand grip. 
  The hand grip performed for hook activity was in such a way that a bag weighing around 2 kilogram was grabbed using four fingers and lifted up by all 8 subjects. 
- The span activity was performed by slightly lifting an object using the span of hand. 
- The electrodes were placed on muscles having noticeable contraction while performing activities such as hook and span. Four muscles were selected for the data collection and assigned to four channels.
